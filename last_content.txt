1337 wants to meet you!

xit's time for us to meet you. Congratulations on passing the online tests, now you will complete your check-in before choosing your piscine date.
Come to meet the 1337 staff, with others who have also passed the online tests. The check-in is where you will learn more about 1337 and what awaits you as you continue this adventure. This is not an interview.
You need to choose a date and time from the 'check-ins' at one of the available scheduled times listed on your admissions space. If there are no available check-in times that you will be able to attend, you can check back at a later time to select a more convenient one. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter @1337FIL to be the first to know when new ones open up! This is a requirement if you would like to proceed with your application to 1337.
Note that your presence at this meeting is a condition for access to the "piscine" and therefore to progress with your application to 1337.
You are allowed to bring one other person along.
If all the check-ins are full or you can't make any of them, don't worry we will open some more soon.
Plan for the meeting to be about 2 hours.





New 'check-ins' spots will open soon. To be informed when some will open, you can follow us on twitter or like us on facebook:
